     <h2>Pizza</h2>
     <p class="p2"> September 23, 2021 by Kali Soutar</p>
     </article> <img class = "img1" src="pizza.jpg" alt= "pizza"> It is said that the first Pizza was made in  southwestern Italy. It started of as simple flat bread with toppings but has now evloved. Pizza was not popular outside of Italy until World War II. Pizza has now become a common meal that can incorprate food from different cultures as toppings are limitless. The main ingredients of pizza are the crust, sauce, cheese and the toppings. The toppings on pizza can usual lead to debate for example if Pinapples slices should go on pizza. The simple answer to this is no, well for me that is. <p> The most common pizza topping is pepperoni and I mean do you really need an epalanation for that? Clearly its the most common for a reason. In Jamaica we have a few Pizza places for example, Pizza Hut,  Domino's, Little Caesars,Pizza Please and others.</p>  </article>
